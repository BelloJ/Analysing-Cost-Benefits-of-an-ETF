        "### 1.1 ETF Benefits\n",
        "* **Diversification:** exchange traded funds essentially have some form of diversification built in already. The benefits of diversification is built into the DNA of ETFs. For example, you can invest in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(SPY) which tracks the S&P 500. This allows you to effectively invest in 500 companies at once instead of actually having to buy the stocks of 500 companies individually. You can reap the diversification benefits from this. Most ETFs even rebalance every quarter so you don't have to worry about that either.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Survivorship Bias:** There are a lot of ETFs, some of which follow strict rules on which companies can be included or not. Let's say we have an ETF called ABC. ABC requires companies to have over a \\\\$100mn market cap. This means that anytime one of the holding comapnies within ABC falls below \\\\$100 million, the ETF is forced to sell it and buy a new company. This introduces a clear bias to only hold onto companies that are doing well. This can be a huge benefit to investors in certain situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Broader Predictions:** ETFs allow you to make a prediction without being an expert in a certain industry - Let's say you expected the semiconductor market to do well over the next year but didn't know specifically which company to buy. ETFs simplify this thought process by allowing you to buy into one ETF, which contains shares of individual semiconductor stocks  \n",

        "### 1.2 ETF Benefits: Diversification\n",
        "In this project, we will further illustrate the benefits of diversification through ETFs. Imagine the year is 2006 and your two friends Elaine and Jerry both conclude that banks and financial institutions will be fantastic long-term investments for the next 15+ years. Jerry is confident with his stock-picking skills, so he decides he's going to invest all of his money into a company he can't imagine in a million years could fail, Lehman Brothers. Elaine doesn't know as much about specific financial institutions and what to invest in, so she decides she will just invest her money into an ETF, XLF. XLF is the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund; it contains exposure to the U.S. financials sector. It's cap-weighted, S&P 500-only portfolio, which means that itâ€™s concentrated in large banks and avoids small-caps (XLF).\n",
        "\n",
        "If you had to guess, who do you think had better performance since the start of 2006? You can probably see where this is going. If you're unaware, Lehman Brothers famously collapsed in 2008 and filed for the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. This means Jerry likely lost his entire initial investment.\n"
